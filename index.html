<h3 id="bagian 1"><b>SANDCAT<b></h3></p>
<hr>
<p> Surely the cutest animal you are ever likely to see in a desert, sandcats are small felines native to the stony and sandy plains of North Africa and Southwest and Central Asia.
Although they may look like your adorable moggy, they are far from a tame housecat. Their diet primarily consists of small rodents like mice and gerbils, but they sometimes feed on venomous vipers.
These fearless snake hunters first stun their prey with rapid blows to the head, then finish them off with a bite to the neck. As well as being fierce predators, they must be very hardy to survive the harsh desert climate. 
To survive the heat of the day they dig impressive burrows to hide away in. When they do venture out their paws are protected by long insulating hair, preventing scorching in the day and freezing at night when temperatures can dip below zero.

<h3 id="bagian 2"> <b> THORNY DEVIL </b></h3>
<hr>
<p>Worth a spot on our list for the name alone, the thorny devil is also just a very fascinating animal. As well as making it resemble a little spikey dragon, this Australian native’s thorny skin also has a very important function in helping it survive in the desert.
The ridged scales act as water collectors! By simply touching its body to a source of water, such as dew, soil moisture, and rain, it can draw it towards its mouth along the channels between the scales. The water moves against gravity by capillary action. This amazing ability to drink water through its skin makes this lizard a master of the desert habitat

<h3 id="bagian 3" <b> SAHARAN SILVER ANT <b></h3>
<hr>
<p>the next animal on our list holds the impressive distinction of being the world’s fastest ant! At full running speed, it clocks in at a whopping 855 millimetres per second (which is over 1.9 miles per hour).
This super speed allows them to hunt in the full force of the Saharan sun without succumbing to heat shock. Ground temperatures often reach as much as 60 degrees Celsius, so it is very important not to linger too long. When they venture out of their nest they do so at high speed and for only around ten minutes a day, gathering up the corpses of less hardy animals to eat once back inside. </p>
<br><br>
<h3 id="bagian 4"> <b> FENNEC FOX </b></h3>
<hr>
<p> 
one of the world's cutest animals, this little fox with big ears can be found prowling the sand dunes and grasses of the Sahara (one of the biggest deserts in the world).
It is the world’s smallest fox species, and indeed the smallest canid, at only around 16 inches in length. Their outsized ears, which can be as much as half the length of their body, serve to dissipate excess heat and cool down their body. They also allow them to listen for their prey - small vertebrates and insects which are often found under the sand.

<h3 id="bagian 5" > <b> ROADRUNNER </b></h3>
<hr>
<p>You may think you know a bit about roadrunners but you could well be misinformed. They don’t go “meep meep” and they are not in fact faster than a coyote.
Although they can sprint pretty fast, up to about 20 miles per hour, coyotes outstrip that with ease, reaching 40mph. Roadrunners are native to the southern United States and Mexico and prefer arid grasslands and deserts. They are actually capable of flight but when faced with a predator they tend to run rather than fly away.
